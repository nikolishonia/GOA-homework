        <h2 id="cb"> Cebid Monkeys </h2>
        <img src="https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/101681/original.jpg">
        <p><i> Cebid monkeys are arboreal animals that only rarely travel on the ground. They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size up to that of the brown capuchin, with a body length of 33 to 56 cm, and a weight of 2.5 to 3.9 kilograms. They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World monkeys.
        They are omnivorous, mostly eating fruit and insects, although the proportions of these foods vary greatly between species. They have the dental formula:
        2.1.3.2-3
        2.1.3.2-3
        Females give birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 130 and 170 days, depending on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally diurnal in habit. Previously, New World monkeys were divided between Callitrichidae and this family. For a few recent years, marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families Aotidae, Pitheciidae and Atelidae.[2] The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, leaving only the capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family. </i></p>

        <p><i> “Midget” is the youngest member of a family (six in all) of douroucoulis at the Bronx Zoo’s World of Darkness. The only true nocturnal monkey, this species is also known as “owl monkey” or “night monkey”. The douroucouli ranges from Panama to northern Argentina and Paraguay and is generally found in forest habitats. Douroucouli form pair bonds and live in family groups of the mated pair with their immature offspring.
        At the Zoo, a douroucouli can feast on greens, fruits, vegetables and insects. They are very engaging as they climb, leap and chatter throughout their Zoo home and are a favorite among staff and Zoo-goers alike as they are cute, furry and quite inquisitive. There are eight or nine species of douroucoulis. </i></p>

        <img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/13/47/86/82/360_F_1347868234_J6ybVP7JOfwuYCwMn1ZxdHOKzgC2yXZT.jpg">
        <p><i> Spider monkeys are New World monkeys belonging to the genus Ateles, part of the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus consists of seven species, all of which are under threat; the brown spider monkey is critically endangered. They are also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity.
        Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name. Spider monkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest and forage in the high canopy, from 25 to 30 m (82 to 98 ft).[2] They primarily eat fruits, but will also occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects.[2] Due to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen forests, and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest.[2] They are social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals, but will split up to forage during the day.[3]
        Recent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are the most intelligent New World monkeys.[4] They can produce a wide range of sounds and will "bark" when threatened; other vocalisations include a whinny similar to a horse and prolonged screams.[3]
        They are an important food source due to their large size, so are widely hunted by local human populations; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due to logging and land clearing.[3] Spider monkeys are susceptible to malaria and are used in laboratory studies of the disease.[3] The population trend for spider monkeys is decreasing; the IUCN Red List lists one species as vulnerable, five species as endangered and one species as critically endangered. </i></p>

        <h2 id="pc"> Pitheciinae </h2>
        <img src="https://elmwoodparkzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1920x1080-Saki.jpg">
        <p><i> Pitheciinae is a subfamily of the New World monkey family Pitheciidae. It contains three genera and 14 species. Pitheciines are forest dwellers from northern and central South America, east of the Andes.
        They are small to medium-sized primates, with a stocky build due to their close skin. The skin is covered in shaggy fur, its coloring varies depending upon species from black to grey and brown up to white. Parts of the face can be bald. The tail, which is not used for grasping but for balance, is also hairy, although the uakari's tail is only a stub.
        Like most New World monkeys, they are diurnal and arboreal. They are good climbers and spend the majority of their life in the trees. They live in groups ranging in number from small groups (such as with the saki monkeys ) to as many as 50 animals. They communicate with a set of sounds which typically includes high cries and a nearly bird-like twitter.
        Pitheciines are generally omnivores, the main part of their diet coming from fruits and insects. This is supplemented by flowers, buds, nuts and small vertebrates. Large canines help them to break through the hard rind of the unripe fruits.[citation needed]
        Births are typically of single offspring with a gestation time of about 5 to 6 months. They typically reach maturity at approximately 3 to 4 years and can become up to 15 years old. </i></p>

        <h2 id="ct"> Callitrichidae </h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Tamarin_portrait_2_edit3.jpg/500px-Tamarin_portrait_2_edit3.jpg">
        <p><i> The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called the Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.
        This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage, from which all the larger-bodied platyrrhines evolved.[4] However, some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage.[5][6]
        Ancestral stem-callitrichids likely were "normal-sized" ceboids that were dwarfed through evolutionary time. This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context, with the "islands" being formed by biogeographic barriers during arid climatic periods when forest distribution became patchy, and/or by the extensive river networks in the Amazon Basin.[5]
        All callitrichids are arboreal. They are the smallest of the simian primates. They eat insects, fruit, and the sap or gum from trees; occasionally, they take small vertebrates. The marmosets rely quite heavily on tree exudates, with some species (e.g. Callithrix jacchus and Cebuella pygmaea) considered obligate exudativores.[7]
        Callitrichids typically live in small, territorial groups of about five or six animals. Their social organization is unique among primates, and is called a "cooperative polyandrous group". This communal breeding system involves groups of multiple males and females, but only one female is reproductively active. Females mate with more than one male and each shares the responsibility of carrying the offspring.[8]
        They are the only primate group that regularly produces twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied. Unlike other male primates, male callitrichids generally provide as much parental care as females. Parental duties may include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with offspring. In some cases, such as in the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), males, particularly those that are paternal, even show a greater involvement in caregiving than females.[9] The typical social structure seems to constitute a breeding group, with several of their previous offspring living in the group and providing significant help in rearing the young. </i></p>
