    <h2> Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs </h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Sayenko_suprunyuck.jpg">
    <p><i> The Dnepropetrovsk maniacs are Ukrainian serial killers responsible for a string of murders in Dnepropetrovsk in June and July 2007. <br> The case gained worldwide notoriety after the killers made video recordings of some of the murders, with one of the videos leaking to the Internet. <br> The two 19 year olds, <b>Viktor Sayenko</b> (born 1 March 1988), and <b>Igor Suprunyuk</b> (born 20 April 1988), were arrested and charged with 21 murders. </i></p>
    <p><i> Sayenko, Suprunyuk, and Hanzha were all born in 1988 to wealthy, influential parents and attended school together. The three individuals had several fears, which they dealt with by doing strange activities, such as standing on a balcony of their apartment, hanging over the railing to combat their fear of heights. Hanzha had hemophobia, which Suprunyuk suggested tackling by torturing and killing stray dogs. The three then proceeded to do so and taking pictures of them standing beside the corpses. <br>  The boys were also apparently enthusiasts over the Nazi cause. After graduating high school, Sayenko and Hanzha went to their own jobs, while Suprunyuk, officially being unemployed, became an unlicensed taxi driver. <br> The three took up robbing Suprunyuk's passengers, some of whom were reported to later wind up as their victims. On March 1, 2007, Hanzha committed two armed robberies that he would end charged for. <br> Eventually, Sayenko and Suprunyuk apparently lost interest in robbing and decided to take it to the next step, murdering random people for the sheer thrill of it. </i></p>
    <h3> Trial </h3>
    <p><i> The three men were charged with involvement in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived. Suprunyuk was charged with 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and one count of animal cruelty. Sayenko was charged with 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies, and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha was charged with two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in Kamianske. </i></p>
    <p><i> All three confessed quickly, although Suprunyuk later withdrew his confession. Their trial began in June 2008. Suprunyuk pleaded not guilty, while the other two suspects pleaded guilty to all charges. Viktor Chevguz, Suprunyuk's original defense lawyer, left the case after reportedly being disappointed that his client's plea of insanity was not accepted. Lawyers for the victims' families argued that the level of care taken by the killers during their crime spree meant that they were fully aware of their actions. </i></p>
    <p><i> Prosecution evidence included blood-stains on the suspects' clothing and video recordings of the murders. The defense denied that the people in the videos were the suspects, claiming serious problems with the investigation, including at least 10 more murders covered up by the prosecution, supposed cover-ups of additional arrests of people with powerful connections who were released without being charged, even naming some of the additional people supposedly involved with the murders. The case was heard by a panel of judges chaired by judge Ivan Senchenko. The prosecution asked for life imprisonment for Sayenko and Suprunyuk, and 15 years of hard labor for Hanzha. Ukraine has no capital punishment since February 2000 after the Constitutional Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in December 1999. </i></p>
    <h3> Sentencing </h3>
    <p><i> On 11 February 2009, the court in Dnipro found Sayenko and Suprunyuk guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced both to life imprisonment. Suprunyuk was found guilty of 21 murders, Sayenko of 18. They also received fifteen-year sentences after being found guilty on the robbery charges. Hanzha, who was not involved in the killings, was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to nine years in prison. Sayenko and Suprunyuk were also found guilty on the animal cruelty charges. Hanzha said of Sayenko and Suprunyuk: "If I had known the atrocities that they were capable of committing, I would have not gone near them at gunpoint." The judge stated in the verdict that the main motive for the crimes had been a desire for "morbid self-affirmation". Referring to the accused, the court noted "the poverty of their emotional world, and their absence of interest in people and moral standards". </i></p>
    <p><i> The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk repeated their belief in the innocence of their sons. Vladimir Suprunyuk claimed that Igor had been tortured to extract his confession, with the police covering his head and forcing him to inhale cigarette smoke. Speaking at a televised press conference, he cited irregularities in the investigation and said that the case against his son was false. Sayenko claimed that his son was a scapegoat and that the crimes were committed by relatives of senior officials. The parents stated their intent to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk also argued that the sentence on Hanzha was too lenient. An opinion poll conducted in Dnipro found that 50.3% of people believed that the sentence was fair, and 48.6% believed that the sentence should have been more severe. In April 2011, a poll found that nearly 60% of Ukrainians wanted the death penalty available for serial killings where judicial error had been ruled out. </i></p>
