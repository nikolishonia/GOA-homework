    <p><i> Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981 – April 20, 1999) was born in Wichita, Kansas. The Harris family relocated often, as Harris's father was a US Air Force transport pilot. His mother was a homemaker. <br> The family moved from Plattsburgh, New York, to Littleton, Colorado, in July 1993, when his father retired from military service. </i></p>
    <p><i> The Harris family lived in rented accommodations for their first three years in the Littleton area. During this time, Harris attended Ken Caryl Middle School, where he met Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased a house south of CHS. Harris's older brother attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder. </i></p>
    <h4> Dylan Klebold </h4>

    <p><i> Dylan Bennet Klebold was born in Lakewood, Colorado. His parents were pacifists and attended a Lutheran church with their children. Both Dylan and his older brother, Byron, attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition. <br> As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet—in his case Dylan Thomas. </i></p>

    <h3> Motive </h3>
    <p><i> The shooting was planned as a terrorist attack that would cause "the most deaths in US history", but the motive has never been ascertained with any degree of certainty. In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A. Dunaway wrote they "cannot answer the most fundamental question—why?" In the days following the event, media speculation regarding the killers' motive was rife. Media reports were disseminated suggesting various motives of the killers, although all theories were largely unsubstantiated and turned out to be myths.These reports included blaming bullying, goth culture, video games, Marilyn Manson, and targeting jocks and minorities. Other rumors were spread in the local area but not largely disseminated by the media, such as the false claim spread by some students that the killers were bullied because they were homosexual. </i></p>
