    <p><i> The Chevrolet Impala (/ɪmˈpælə, -ˈpɑːlə/) is a full-size car that was built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and was among the better-selling American-made automobiles in the United States.[7][8]
    For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-sized model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.
    In 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive car.[9] In February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked No. 1 among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings.[10] When the 10th generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the 9th generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time, both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The 10th-generation Impala was also sold in the Middle East and South Korea. 
    The Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 General Motors Motorama show car that bore Corvette-like design cues, especially the grille. It was named Impala after the graceful African antelope, which was used as the car's logo. Painted emerald green metallic, with a white interior, the Impala concept car featured hardtop styling. Clare MacKichan's design team, along with designers from Pontiac, started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors "A" body in June. The first styling sketch that directly influenced the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling Vice President Harley Earl in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed.
    For 1958, GM was promoting its 50th year of business, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.[13] The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.
    The Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as a top-of-the-line Bel Air in 2-door hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield (A) pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower-priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.
    The 1958 Chevrolet models were longer, lower, and wider than their predecessors.[14] The 1958 model year was the first with dual headlamps. The tailfins of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas had three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. The Impalas included crossed-flag insignias above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops.
    The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated "X". Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity[12] and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis; the body structure was also strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall.[15] However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side-impact crash as a traditional perimeter frame.
    A coil spring suspension replaced the previous year's rear leaf springs, and an air-ride system was optional.
    A 283 cu in (4,640 cc) engine was the standard V8, with ratings of 185 hp (138 kW), 230 hp (170 kW), and 250 hp (190 kW) with optional Rochester Ramjet fuel injection. Two versions of Chevrolet's 348 cu in (5,700 cc) V8, its first big-block, were also optional, producing 250 hp (190 kW) with a single four-barrel carburetor and 280 hp (210 kW) with three two-barrels.[16]
    In total, 55,989 Impala convertibles and 125,480 coupes were built representing 15% of Chevrolet production. The 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala helped Chevrolet regain the number-one production spot in this recession year.    
    As part of a GM economy move, the 1959 Chevrolet Impala was redesigned to share bodyshells with lower-end Buicks, Oldsmobiles, and Pontiacs. Using a new X-frame chassis, the roof line was 3 inches lower, bodies were 2 inches wider, the wheelbase was 1-1/2 inches longer, and curb weight increased. Flattened tailfins protruded outward, rather than upward. The taillights were a large "teardrop" design at each side, and two slim-wide, non-functional front air intake scoops were added just above the grille.
    The Impala became a separate series, adding a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan to the two-door Sport Coupe and convertible and a five-door station wagon. Sport Coupes featured a shortened roof line and wrap-over back window. The standard engine was an I6, while the base V8 was the carryover 283 cu in (4.6 L), at 185 hp (138 kW). Optional were a 283 cu in with 290 hp (220 kW) and 348 cu in (5.7 L) V8 up to 335 hp (250 kW). Standard were front and rear armrests, an electric clock, dual sliding sun visors, and crank-operated front vent windows. A contoured hooded instrument panel held deep-set gauges. A six-way power seat was a new option, as was "Speedminder," which allowed the driver to set a needle at a specific speed, which triggered a buzzer when exceeded.
    The 1960 Impala models reinstated three round taillights on each side, and a white band running along the rear fenders.
    Seven versions of the 283-cu in and 348-cu in V8s were offered: the carbureted 283 Turbo-Fire could have either 170 or 230 hp (130 or 170 kW). The 348 was available in 250 to 320 hp (190 to 240 kW) with a 350 hp (260 kW) Special Super Turbo-Thrust with triple two-barrel carburetors, 11.25:1 compression ratio, and dual exhausts. Fuel injection was no longer an option on full-size Chevrolets.[14] New to the options list was cruise control. Production was 490,000 units. </i></p>
