            <p><i> The Alaskan Malamute (/ˈmæləˌmjuːt/) is a large breed of dog that was originally bred for its strength and endurance, to haul heavy freight as a sled dog.[2] It is similar to other arctic breeds such as the husky, the spitz, the Greenland Dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky, and the Samoyed. Although it is believed that the first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago, followed by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, with both originating from Siberia.[3] Malamutes were thought to be bred by the Malimiut Inupiaq people of Alaska's Norton Sound region. The Malamute has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A study in 2013 showed that the Alaskan Malamute has a similar east Asian origin to, but is not clearly related to, the Greenland dog and the Canadian Eskimo dog, but contains a possible admixture of the Siberian husky. In 2015, a study using several genetic markers indicated that the Malamute, the Siberian husky, and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate from the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo dog and the Greenland dog. In North America, the Malamute and the Siberian husky both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America.[3] DNA extracted from a 9,500-year-old dog, Zhokhov, named after the Siberian island, was found to have shared a common ancestor with the Greenland sledge dog, the Alaskan Malamute and the Siberian husky. The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard describes a natural range of size, with a desired size of 23 inches (58 cm) tall and 75 pounds (34 kg) for females, 25 inches (64 cm) tall and 85 pounds (39 kg) for males.[7] Heavier individuals (90 lb (41 kg)) and dogs smaller than 75 pounds (34 kg) are commonly seen. There is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of 100 pounds (45 kg) are also seen. The Alaskan Malamute is double coated. The undercoat has an oily and woolly texture and can be as thick as two inches.[7] The outer guard coat is coarse and stands off the body longer at the withers but not more than one inch off the sides of the body. Ears are small in proportion to the head and stand firmly erect when at attention. The Alaskan Malamute is a heavy dog, with a more formidable nature and structure than the Siberian Husky, which is bred for speed. The Alaskan Malamute is bred for power and endurance, which is its original function and what the standard of the breed requires of Alaskan Malamute breeders. The usual colors are various shades of grey and white, sable and white, black and white, seal and white, red and white, or solid white.[8] There are a wide range of markings in the breed including face markings, blazes, a splash at the nape of the neck, and a collar or half collar. White is often the predominant color on the body, parts of the legs, feet, and part of the markings of the face. In terms of color variants, some Malamutes exhibit a dark grey to buff-colored undertone around their trimmings and white areas, presenting with a color-linked gene known as agouti. Two agouti alleles, with the possibility of a third, appear to be found in Malamutes: aw (agouti pattern or wolf/wild pattern), at (tan point pattern or black pattern), and awat (heterozygous agouti or dark agouti). The eyes of the Alaskan Malamute are almond shaped and varied shades of brown; however, the darker eye is preferred. Purebred Alaskan Malamutes will not have blue eyes. The physical build of the Malamute is compact and strong with substance, bone and snowshoe feet. According to the AKC breed standard, the Malamute's tail is well furred and is carried over the back like a waving plume. Corkscrew tails (commonly seen in the Akita) are occasionally seen but are faulted in the AKC breed standard. The Malamutes' well-furred tails aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow. They are often seen wrapping the tail around their nose and face, which presumably protects them against such harsh weather elements as blowing snow. Their ears are generally upright, wedge shaped, small in proportion to the head, and set to the side of the skull. The muzzle is deep and broad, tapering slightly from the skull to the nose. Nose and gums are black, but some Malamutes have a snow nose, which is black with a pink undertone that can get darker or lighter, depending on the season.
