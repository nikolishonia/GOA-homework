        <p><i> A touring motorcycle is a type of motorcycle designed for touring. Although almost any motorcycle can be used for this purpose,[1] manufacturers have developed specific models designed to address the particular needs of these riders. Touring motorcycles commonly have large displacement fairings and windshields that offer a high degree of weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long-distance riding, engines with a great deal of low-end horsepower, and a more relaxed, upright seating position than sport bikes.
        Particularly in the US, touring motorcycles may be given names such as bagger, full bagger, full dresser, full dress tourer, or dresser. These monikers (often used disparagingly or jocularly) originally applied to cruisers with full sets of saddlebags or panniers such as Harley-Davidsons; but these terms may now refer to any touring motorcycle.

        <p><i> A cruiser motorcycle is a motorcycle in the style of those made by American manufacturers such as Harley-Davidson, Indian, Excelsior and Henderson from the 1930s to the early 1960s. The riding position usually places the feet forward and the hands up, with the spine upright or leaning back slightly. Typical cruiser engines emphasize easy rideability and shifting, with plenty of low-end torque, but not necessarily large amounts of horsepower, and are traditionally V-twins. However, inline engines have become more common. Cruisers with greater performance than usual, including bigger engines with more horsepower, stronger brakes, and better suspension, are often called power cruisers. Japanese companies began producing models evocative of the early cruisers in the mid-1980s, and by 1997 the market had grown to nearly 60 percent of the US market.[3] A number of motorcycle manufacturers including BMW, Honda, Moto Guzzi, Yamaha, Suzuki, Triumph and Victory have currently or have had important models evocative of the American cruiser. Harley-Davidsons and other cruisers with extensive luggage for touring have been called, sometimes disparagingly or jocularly, baggers, or full baggers, as well as dressers, full dressers, or full dress tourers. These terms are no longer limited to cruisers, but may be any touring motorcycle. Cruisers are often the basis for custom motorcycle projects that result in a bike modified to suit the owner's ideals, and as such are a source of pride and accomplishment. Power cruiser bikes are named for their higher levels of power. They often feature upgraded brakes and suspensions, better ground clearance, and premium surface finishes, and may have more exotic or modern muscular (non-traditional cruiser) styling.[8][9][10][11][12]Many power cruisers and Japanese cruisers of the 1980s have more neutral riding positions. While traditional cruisers have limited performance and turning ability due to a low-slung design, power cruisers or similar performance-oriented cruisers can be leaned further for better cornering. Otherwise, customization can increase the bike's lean angle to enable cornering at higher speeds.

        <p><i> Off-road motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes or scramblers, are specially designed for off-road use. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes in recent decades, and minibikes even earlier) or vehicles are designed to better handle off-road conditions. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are lighter and more flexible, typically having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and are geared higher to provide more torque in off-road situations.[34] Wheels (usually 21" front, 18" rear)[citation needed] have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock.[6][35] [36] Many competitive events have emerged[when?] and developed into a variety of off-road motorcycle sports, for which a number of specialized motorcycles have been built:
        Motocross - Such bikes are raced on short, closed off-road tracks with a variety of obstacles. The motorcycles have a small fuel tank for lightness and compactness. Long-travel suspension allows riders to take jumps at high speed. Motocross engines are single-cylinder two-stroke or four-stroke units, which vary in size from 50cc up to about 500cc. At the professional level, bikes are split up into two levels based on their displacements: MX and MX Lite. The MX Lite class contains 125cc two-stroke engines and 250cc four-stroke engines, while the MX class pits 250cc two-stroke engines against 450cc four-stroke engines. The actual displacement for both four-strokes and two-strokes can be under what is listed for the different bikes. The differences in power, displacement, torque, and weight are all variables that balance the competition between two-stroke and four-stroke engines.[37] Motocross sidecar outfits have bigger engines, usually four-stroke and often twin-cylinder.
